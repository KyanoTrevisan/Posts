## A Scathing Review of the Current System

As we navigate the treacherous waters of modern taxation, it's high time we take a closer look at the system that's got us all in a twist. The concept of taxing income and sales can be seen as a form of double taxation, where individuals are taxed on their earnings and then again when they spend that money. It's like being robbed twice! This article will delve into the dark history of taxation, the crippling impact of double taxation, and the catastrophic consequences of excessive money printing.

#### The Bloody History of Taxation

Taxation has been around since ancient times, with evidence of taxes being collected in Mesopotamia dating back to 3,000 BCE (Garnsey & Saller, 1987). But it wasn't until the American Revolution that taxation became a hot button issue. The British were taxing their colonists without representation, and the Americans were having none of it! They threw off the yoke of oppression and created a new nation built on the principles of liberty and democracy (Katz, 2009).

But fast forward to today, and we've got a tax system that's more complicated than a plate of spaghetti. The 16th Amendment to the US Constitution gave Congress the power to impose an income tax on individuals, but it was a necessary evil to finance World War I efforts (Internal Revenue Service, n.d.).

#### Double Taxation: The Unintended Consequences

When someone gives you cash or other income, it's considered taxable income to you, even if the person who gave it to you already paid taxes on it. This is known as "receipt of income" or "income received" (Internal Revenue Service, n.d.). When you use this money to buy something, like a car or a gift, you'll need to pay sales tax on the purchase price of the item.

This double taxation can have significant consequences for individuals and businesses. According to a study by the Tax Foundation, the combined federal-state-local tax rate in the United States is 34.5%, with some states having rates as high as 43.6% (Tax Foundation, 2020).

#### The Risks of Excessive Money Printing

Excessive money printing can lead to inflation, where the value of currency decreases due to increased supply. In extreme cases, it can even contribute to hyperinflation, where prices skyrocket and purchasing power plummets.

A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that a 10% increase in the money supply can lead to a 2-3% increase in inflation (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 2019). Another study by economists from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Chicago found that hyperinflation can occur when the money supply grows too quickly, leading to a loss of faith in the currency (Sargent & Velde, 1995).

#### Conclusion

The current system of taxation is complex and multifaceted. While it provides necessary revenue for governments to fund public services and infrastructure, it also has unintended consequences, such as double taxation.

As we navigate the challenges of modern taxation, it's essential to consider the historical context, the impact of double taxation, and the risks associated with excessive money printing. By examining these issues and engaging in ongoing discussion and refinement, we can work towards a more equitable and efficient tax system that balances individual needs with the needs of society.
