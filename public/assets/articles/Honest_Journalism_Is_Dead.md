#### Bias and Advocacy

Increasingly, news outlets cater to a specific ideological audience. Reportage becomes skewed to support pre-existing viewpoints rather than delivering objective facts. This creates echo chambers rather than fostering informed debate.

A news outlet focused on conservative politics may downplay negative statistics about a conservative government while a progressive outlet will give disproportionate coverage to these same figures.

  

#### Clickbait and Ad Revenue

The need for clicks to drive ad revenue pushes news outlets toward sensationalism. Headlines are deliberately misleading to provoke clicks, while stories lack substance or prioritize entertainment value over factual reporting.

An article with the headline "You Won't Believe What This Celebrity Did!" is designed to provoke curiosity, even if the content is ultimately trivial.

  

#### Social Media and The Disinformation Age

Social media platforms provide fertile ground for the spread of misinformation and unsubstantiated claims. This is amplified by filter bubbles that isolate users within groups sharing similar biases, furthering the erosion of a shared understanding of reality.

A fake news article fabricated and shared across social media may go viral before credible fact-checking can catch up. Many people will see the headline, accept it as true, and never encounter the debunking.



#### Decline of Investigative Journalism

Investigative journalism is time-intensive, costly, and often risky. News outlets under economic pressure may reduce these efforts. This leaves important scandals, corruption, and abuse of power less likely to be exposed.

Past landmark investigative work, like uncovering the Watergate scandal, may become less likely as newspapers and news programs struggle for funding.
